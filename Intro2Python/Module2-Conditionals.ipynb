    "## Conditionals and code indendation\n",
    "In Python, code blocks are separated by use of indentation. See the defintion of an `if`-statement below:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Syntax of conditional blocks\n",
    "    \n",
    "```python\n",
    "if condition:\n",
    "    # Code goes here (must be indented!)\n",
    "    # Otherwise, IndentationError will be thrown\n",
    "\n",
    "# Code placed here is outside of the if-statement    \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Where evaluation of `condition` must return a boolean (`True` or `False`).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Remember:**\n",
    "> 1. The `:` ***must*** be present after `condition`.\n",
    "> 2. The line immediately after `:` ***must*** be indented. \n",
    "> 3. The `if`-statement is ***exited by reverting the indentation*** as shown above.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is how Python interprets the code as a block.    \n",
    "\n",
    "The same indentation rules are required for all types of code blocks, the `if`-block above is just an example. Examples of other types of code blocks are `for` and `while` loops, functions etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "All editors will automatically make the indentation upon hitting enter after the `:`, so it doesn't take long to get used to this. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Comparison to other languages\n",
    "In many other programming languages indentation is not required. It is however still used as good practice to increase code readability. Instead of indentation, code blocks are denoted by encapsulating code in characters like `()`, `{}` etc.\n"
